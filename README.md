- 👋 Hi, I’m @RockitGirl - AKA Jen Flanagan :)
I am a Senior Level Recruitment Professional with over 20 years of recruitment and sourcing experience. I am known for my energetic and positive CAN-DO attitude, combined with excellent judgment skills for hiring the best employees for any given job. I am experienced, well-connected with powerful listening and communication skills and the ability to build strong relationships with hiring managers in every field. Expertise in sourcing, selection, and relationship management. I started my career working in Human Resource Management and decided to make a move into recruitment. I am most fulfilled when helping people to grow professionally. “One of the most rewarding things about being a recruiter for me is being a small part of changing someone’s life. Offering them a position is a big part in progressing their career path and is a true-life changing decision for a candidate, and I am so happy to be a part of that.”
I have recruited for companies such as Microsoft (Talent Sourcing),  Lockheed Martin (Sr Sourcing Recruiter-Electronic Warfare), Walgreens Corporate (Sr Recruiter), and Zep Inc (as a Talent Acquisition Manager). I have very vast experience recruiting for all kinds of roles, at all levels. 
My vision and ability to nurture relationships has lead to long-term solutions and success. With that, I have successfully completed hundreds of successful searches, helping professionals grow and advance in their careers for years.
I am based out of Louisville, KY. I am married to my husband Sean, and have 2 small children (Knox,7 and Maggie, 3).
